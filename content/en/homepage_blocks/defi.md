# Decentralized and trustless through and through.

Owned by no-one, immutable and completely autonomous. Even the community is decentralized, 
with no overpaid CEO, CTO, COO or advisors. 100% of the supply was distributed at launch and 
**every single volunteer purchased their own tokens.**

Initial funds raised to provide liquidity on UniSwap have been locked for 6 months, at which point they will be locked again. 
You can verify the liquidity lock <a target="_blank" href="https://team.finance/view-coin/0x13572851103bEd49FF743AF4C4BB5ace88B22E2F?name=r3fi.finance&symbol=R3FI">on team.finance</a>.
